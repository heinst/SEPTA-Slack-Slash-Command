##Demo

##Usage

`/septa` will get the next two trains to go to Spring Mill (stop I get off at) and towards 30th Street Station. This can be easily changed to suit which stops you normally take.

`/septa 30th Street Station-Radnor` will get the next five trains heading towards Radnor from 30th Street Station and display their status. Note: the use of the hyphen is necessary. That is what I use to separate the stations as Slack gives you the input for the slash command as one block of text.
